# Campaign 1

##	Opening

*Our story begins at Coronet, the booming industrial capital city of Corellia. With the active Coronet spaceport as a backdrop, the **Galactic Investigator Aegis** reports to a three-way speeder collision in the middle of a busy street...* 

` "What happened here agent?"` , Aegis asks the Corellian Security Enforcer. The agent explains that a Ithorian recklessly blew threw the intersection and all but collided with two other landspeeders in the process. The pilots of the landspeeders, one an Iktotchi and the other a Lasat, were both lucky enough to be generally unharmed. Their speeders however, were in much worse shape, and would likely never run again...
