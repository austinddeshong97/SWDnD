# Campaign 01 - Session 001 - MM/DD/2021

## Before First Session

`Each player will receive the following overview for the immediate context and circumstances surrounding their character`



#### Aicanaro Alatya

> Aican crash-landed on Nanth'ri after the Repulsor-lifts failed on his ship. He walked about 15mi to the nearest settlement, which lucky for him, was a spaceport. He found an Ithorian ship master willing to help him repair his ship. He payed the Ithorian 1,500cr to retrieve his ship from the surrounding forest where he crashed, and repair it.
>
> A few days later, he returned to check on his ship, only to be told by the Ithorian that it was beyond repair and all that he was able to salvage was the Sublight drive engines, and refuses to give Aican back his deposit, as the Ithorian's crew still labored in trying to repair the ship.
>
> Discouraged, and all but out of credits, Aican journeys to the cantina adjacent to the main landing bays in an attempt to find someone to help him in his plight...

* Aicanaro starts this adventure with 200cr, a set of Sublight Drive Engines, and whatever gear he normally carries



#### OshKosh B'Gosh

> OshKosh sets down his BT-7 Thunderclap, *The Sentinel's Stand*, in Bay 9 of the Totora Spaceport on Nanth'ri. The Sublight drive on his ship are shot, and limped his way in on Repulsor-lifts only. 
>
> Perhaps he can get some information on where to find decent drive parts in the local cantina...

* OshKosh starts this adventure with 1000cr and whatever gear he normally carries



#### Zevaa Cir'du

> Zevaa just completed a job for a local Rebel cell on Nanth'ri. She eliminated key Imperial officers at the city of Ba'lorka and allowed the Rebels to steal a shuttle with Imperial data on board. She is currently lying low in Totora, but wants to get off world sooner rather than later in case things get sticky. Maybe she can find a ship off world in the cantina...

* Zevaa starts this adventure with 5000cr and whatever gear she normally carries



## Pre-Session Debrief

### Overview of Spacecraft Interaction and Mechanics

#### Nomenclature

* Navicomputer: Contains a map of the galaxy, can calculate lightspeed jumps, and can find hyperspace lanes
* Helm: Main controls for piloting a ship. 
* Weapons: Some ships have weapon controls at the helm, some have a separate weapon terminal, some have independent turrets that can be manned.
* Sublight Drive: Engines that let the ship maneuver through real-space
* Repulsor-lifts: Engines that keep a ship in the sky when within a planets atmosphere or gravitational pull.
* Hyperdrive: Engine that allows the ship to leave real-space and move through hyperspace at lightspeed. There are different classes of hyperdrives that can either shorten or lengthen the duration of lightspeed journeys.



#### Mechanics

* Whenever a jump to lightspeed is to occur, the hyperdrive must be primed, and the journey must be programmed into the ships navigation
* In order to prime the Hyperdrive, you must be out of a planets orbit, and it take 1 minute to power up.
* The jump to lightspeed can be calculated by a character at the Navicomputer, or by a droid with the necessary capabilities.
* To avoid being detected by enemy scanners, all systems on a ship must be powered off, even droids.



#### Notes



### Opportunity to Modify Character Sheets



### Ground Rules

* The only information readily available to you as a player is whatever you can find in the Player's Handbook. Anything beyond that must be cleared by the GM on a case-by-case basis.
* This includes the Galaxy Map. If your character wants to query the map, find a terminal, or use the ships Navicomputer.
* Information about NPCs, ships, enemies, objects, cities, etc, must be learned (within reason). Your characters is not omniscient, so if you don't know something, find a way to find it out. Maybe there's a reason you don't know that thing
* You all will be responsible for your own character sheets, so I may be poking you all for info now and then



#### Notes



## Contextual Debrief

> Nanth'ri is primarily a foresty planet, but also has some grassland regions. It is a mid-rim world under partial Imperial control. The city of Totora is a spaceport and marketplace, and is frequented by traders and travelers, since Nanth'ri is on a converging hyperspace route.

> You are all sitting at the bar in the *Yub Grub Cantina* adjacent to the docking bays of the spaceport.
