## Session Summary

*Players journey to Batuu after following the coordinated on the Sith Holocron they found on Nanth'ri. They set their ship down next to the ruins of a Sith Temple, and search within.

## Session Outline

> Your course is set for the coordinates from the Sith Holocron, and the hyperdrive is primed. As Captain OshKosh pulls back the hyperspace lever, the star stretch into star-lines, and the ship jumps to lightspeed. The journey to Batuu will take roughly a week, so get cozy.

`Give the players the chance to get to know each other if they like`
