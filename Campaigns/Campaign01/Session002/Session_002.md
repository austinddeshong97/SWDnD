# Session 002 Outline

## Session Summary

*Players journey to Batuu after following the coordinated on the Sith Holocron they found on Nanth'ri. They set their ship down next to the ruins of a Sith Temple, and search within. While inside, they are each confronted by visions based on their fears, and a draw to the dark. They will have the choice to follow the dark to find power, or resist and follow the light...*



## Session Outline

> Your course is set for the coordinates from the Sith Holocron, and the hyperdrive is primed. As Captain OshKosh pulls back the hyperspace lever, the star stretch into star-lines, and the ship jumps to lightspeed. The journey to Batuu will take roughly a week, so get cozy.

`Give the players the chance to get to know each other if they like`

> The console starts beeping, alerting you that the journey is nearly complete, and to be ready to pull out of hyperspace. 
>
> As you fall back into real-space, you see the green-brown planet of Batuu, and begin your landing cycle.
>
> The *Sentinel's Stand* sets down in the wilds of Batuu, right where the coordinates led you. As you look out the canopy, you see the landscape of the area. The area is a mix of grassy and rocky terrain, with some vegetation, and a handful of cliffs of varying heights in the distance. A couple hundred feet from the ship, you see a large gray weathered structure.

`Players should decide to disembark and approach the structure`

> As you approach the structure, you see a large dark gray double-door with silver accents at the center of a semi-circle protruding from the structure. A set of steps leads from the ground, up the small elevation to the door.



<mark>As the players enter the temple:</mark>

> As you enter the structure, you see what was once a grand foyer, with half-broken gold statues on the west and east. In front of you stands a stone staircase, and around the steps, you can partially see into the next room.
>
> You all feel a coldness that seems to linger in this place, but none of you can put your finger on it



<mark>If any of the players want to attempt to reach out with the force and sense what's happening:</mark>

**Insight (Wisdom) DC15**

* > You feel a darkness that dwells in this place. Something you never felt before. A sense of terror, but also a sense of control.



```
Any time the players make a choice to interact to intract with objects in the Sith Temple? The experience a feeling of darkness and power.
```



<mark>When the players enter the Sanctum:</mark>

> As you enter, you see the room is a dark, ancient sanctum, with altars around the edge, and markings on the floor. The looming presence you've felt since you entered the temple is the strongest here. 
>
> `Once they move towards the center:`
>
> Your vision becomes clouded and fades away to darkness as you are overwhelmed by the presence in the place. Your vision returns, and you are no longer in the sanctum in the temple. You are each alone, in a familiar place...

<mark>OshKosh</mark>

> You are in your hometown on the world of Iktotch, but not the Iktotch you left. Its more weathered, and less busy than it once was. In a nearby window, you see your reflection, and its not the OshKosh you expected, but a much older and worn down version. You are standing outside your father's shop.
>
> `Presumably he will enter and find his father inside`
>
> * Did you hit your head? You're at home my son, and you always will be, just like me, and your grandfather.
> * There is nothing out there in the galaxy for you. Your path is the one your ancestors walked. 
> * The Jedi were traitors to our people, and fools bound to a worthless religion. It was their pride and sense of control that let the Sith retain control. The Dark side has always be the pathway to greater power, the Jedi were just too blind to see it.
> * Not that any of that matters. You will remain on Iktotch for the rest of your life, and you are too insignificant to make an impact on this world
>
> *The vision fades*
