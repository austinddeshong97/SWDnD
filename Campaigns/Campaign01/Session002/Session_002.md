# Session 002 Outline

## Session Summary

*Players journey to Batuu after following the coordinated on the Sith Holocron they found on Nanth'ri. They set their ship down next to the ruins of a Sith Temple, and search within. While inside, they are each confronted by visions based on their fears, and a draw to the dark. They will have the choice to follow the dark to find power, or resist and follow the light...*



## Session Outline

> Your course is set for the coordinates from the Sith Holocron, and the hyperdrive is primed. As Captain OshKosh pulls back the hyperspace lever, the star stretch into star-lines, and the ship jumps to lightspeed. The journey to Batuu will take roughly a week, so get cozy.

`Give the players the chance to get to know each other if they like`

> The console starts beeping, alerting you that the journey is nearly complete, and to be ready to pull out of hyperspace. 
>
> As you fall back into real-space, you see the green-brown planet of Batuu, and begin your landing cycle.
>
> The *Sentinel's Stand* sets down in the wilds of Batuu, right where the coordinates led you. As you look out the canopy, you see the landscape of the area. The area is a mix of grassy and rocky terrain, with some vegetation, and a handful of cliffs of varying heights in the distance. A couple hundred feet from the ship, you see a large gray weathered structure.

`Players should decide to disembark and approach the structure`

> As you approach the structure, you see a large dark gray double-door with silver accents at the center of a semi-circle protruding from the structure. A set of steps leads from the ground, up the small elevation to the door.



<mark>As the players enter the temple:</mark>

> As you enter the structure, you see what was once a grand foyer, with half-broken gold statues on the west and east. In front of you stands a stone staircase, and around the steps, you can partially see into the next room.
>
> You all feel a coldness that seems to linger in this place, but none of you can put your finger on it



<mark>If any of the players want to attempt to reach out with the force and sense what's happening:</mark>

**Insight (Wisdom) DC15**

* > You feel a darkness that dwells in this place. Something you never felt before. A sense of terror, but also a sense of control.



```
Any time the players make a choice to interact to intract with objects in the Sith Temple, they experience a feeling of darkness and power.
```



<mark>When the players enter the Sanctum:</mark>

> As you enter, you see the room is a dark, ancient sanctum, with altars around the edge, and markings on the floor. The looming presence you've felt since you entered the temple is the strongest here. 
>
> `Once they move towards the center:`
>
> Your vision becomes clouded and fades away to darkness as you are overwhelmed by the presence in the place. Your vision returns, and you are no longer in the sanctum in the temple. You are each alone, in a familiar place...

<mark>OshKosh</mark>

> You are in your hometown on the world of Iktotch, but not the Iktotch you left. Its more weathered, and less busy than it once was. In a nearby window, you see your reflection, and its not the OshKosh you expected, but a much older and worn down version. You are standing outside your father's shop.
>
> `Presumably he will enter and find his father inside`
>
> * Did you hit your head? You're at home my son, and you always will be, just like me, and your grandfather.
> * There is nothing out there in the galaxy for you. Your path is the one your ancestors walked. 
> * The Jedi were traitors to our people, and fools bound to a worthless religion. It was their pride and sense of control that let the Sith retain control. The Dark side has always be the pathway to greater power, the Jedi were just too blind to see it.
> * Not that any of that matters. You will remain on Iktotch for the rest of your life, and you are too insignificant to make an impact on this world
>
> *You hear a male voice call your name as the vision fades*

<mark>Aicanaro</mark>

> You are on the Imperial Capital of Coruscant, on a street that you remember very well. This is where your master died. This is where you let him die. The charges you set in the street to take out the Imperial officer you were hunting. The trap that the Imperials moved. 
>
> Your master is scouting ahead of you, tracking the Imperials, you try to say something. To warn him, to stop this tragedy that has haunted you for years.
>
> Then he stops... Everything stops... He is frozen in the moment before he dies. Then he turns to you, and looks you right in the eyes.
>
> "You weren't good enough Aican. Not fast enough or smart enough. Not powerful enough. And you let me die. Not the Empire; You..."
>
> `Give him chance to speak if he wants`
>
> While still locking eyes, and unable to move, the charges go off on the street, and you are forced to witness your master die for a second time.
>
> *You hear a male voice call your name as the vision fades*

<mark>Zevaa</mark>

>You only vaguely remember where you stand. A memory of a place almost lost in the years since you were actually there. Your birth home on Mirial. You aren't a child however, like you were when you were there last, but the same person you are now. But not quite the same. You aren't wearing your normal assassin armor and equipment, but some form of robes, all black, and hanging from your belt, and strange cylinder that you don't recognize. 
>
>Then, your parents emerge from another room. Older than you remember them, but it has been many years.
>
>Your mother speaks "We're so proud of you Zevaa. You've brought honor to our family."
>
>Then your father, "Yes, we are so impressed by your connection to the Force, especially without the burden of being a Jedi"
>
>Mother: "You are very powerful Zevaa. You will help bring about peace to this troubled galaxy"
>
>`Give her a chance to speak`
>
> *You hear a male voice call your name as the vision fades*



<mark>Upon exiting the Temple:</mark>

> As you exit the temple, a figure in black armor stands between you can your ship. This is the same figure that OshKosh described from the Holo message he viewed while at the Imperial Base.
