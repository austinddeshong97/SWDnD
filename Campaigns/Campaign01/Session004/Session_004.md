# Session004 Outline - 4/3/2021

### Pre-Session Updates

* Zevaa's Sith Staff has the following ablilities:
  * It grants the ability to use the Darkness Dark Side power
  * When the user is holding it, die rolls for Dark Side force powers can use the next die up 



### Session Summary

*The players finally arrive near the location the Jedi Holocron indicated on Acherin. Acherin is a highly dense jungle planet, and they can't find a place to set down their ship close to the location. They land as close as they can, and journey to the location. Once there, they find the remains of a Jedi Encampment from the days of the Republic, where they encounter the Grand Inquisitor, and are rescued by Cal Kestis*



### Session Outline

> As you drop out of hyperspace, you have arrived at the planet Acherin, a dense Jungle planet with many rivers and natural features, and not much obvious civilization. You bring the ship toward the location marked on the Holocron, but it is dense jungle, and there is nowhere nearby to set the ship down.



`Players will presumably attempt to find a suitable place to land as close as they can get from the location`



When they do set the ship down, regardless how, they are **~50 miles (a two-day walk)** from the Holocrons location

* If the players decide too, they may be permitted to record a local map onto a datapad to help navigate the jungle



> As you begin to journey through the jungle, you find that much of the convenient path is obstructed by thick vines
A Strength check of DC12 is required to cut through the vines, or a more creative solution may be presented

* For every failed check, the PC lose a half-hour of travel time



As they near the end of the first day, they encounter their first swarm of Kowakian Monkey Lizards. As they venture through the jungle and into the night, they periodically get attacked by these swarms.

When they arrive at the Holocron location:

> The dense jungle opens up slightly to a less-dense clearing with some remaining tree cover. Surrounding you, is what appears to be the dilapidated ruins of a well established camp.
>
> At the center of the camp stands a small stone tower, about 30ft in diameter and 50ft tall. Surrounding the tower lay what appear to have once been durable tents, some still standing, but many of them collapsed.



`The tents have assorted ruins of the Jedi that once resided in this camp, as well as containers with rations, and the logo of the Grand Army of the Republic.`

`The Tower contains a Juvenile Rancor, and also a data table with an outgoing transmission`

* > The message is over 10 years old during the last days of the Clone Wars.
  >
  > "This message is from the Ilum forward camp on Acherin for the Jedi Counsel on Coruscant. We have been betrayed. The Clones that once served us have turned, and are slaughtering us. The encampment has been lost, and I survived long enough to send this message, but I'm being hunted and my time is near. They are watching Ilum and what was once a place of peace and solitude is no longer a safe refuge. Do not return to Ilum."

Once the party decides to disembark from the tower:

> As you exit the tower, a flash of bright green light illuminates the sky and strikes the ground nearby. As you look up, you see an Imperial Star Destroyer sending turbolaser fire to the area

`Allow them to take cover`

> The turbolaser fire ceases, and you hear the sounds of ship approaching the area

`If they go outside, they meet the Grand Inquisitor as he comes out of his ship. If they hide inside, he comes to them`



`Freeform convo?`



| Grand Inquisitor                                             |

| ACTIONS                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Multiattack.** The inquisitor makes three spinning double saber attacks. |
| **Spinning Double Saber.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit: 23* (4d8 + 5) energy damage. |
| **Dark Lightning.** *Ranged Power Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one or two targets. *Hit:* 28 (8d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or become restrained until the end of the inquisitor's next turn. |

#### Detect Force

* The inquisitor can sense the presence and direction of a creature who can cast force powers within 120 ft.

#### Force-Casting 

* The inquisitor is a 12th-level force-caster. It's force-casting ability is Charisma (force save DC 18, +10 to hit with power attacks). It regains its extended force points when it finishes a long rest. It knows the following powers: 

* At-Will: denounce, force disarm, force push, mind trick, saber throw, slow 1st-5th level (41 Force Points): animate weapon, dominate mind, improved dark side tendrils, choke, force suppression, horror, force jump, sense force, sever force, siphon life, stun 

#### Force Resistance

* The inquisitor has advantage on saving throws against force powers and resistance to damage dealt by force powers.

#### War Casting 

* When the inquisitor uses an action to cast a force power, they can use a bonus action to make a Spinning Double Saber attack.



They presumably fight the GI and will most certainly get destroyed. As they are on their way out and things are looking grim, whoever is about to die encounters the following:

> As the Grand Inquisitor is about to make his slaying blow, a small green object arcs through the air and lands at your feet.
>
> A health stim. As you look along its previous trajectory, you turn and see a small red and white bipedal droid looking at your curiously. 
>
> Then, from out of nowhere, a young man in a green and orange flight suit falls between you and the Grand Inquisitor and ignites his blue double-saber, and they lock lightsabers.
>
> "Get back!", he yells, and you all recognize his voice. Its the same voice you heard break you out of your vision at the Sith Temple. "Head towards the shuttle and get the engines going, I'll keep baldy busy"

Cal keep the GI at bay, as the party retreated to the Imperial shuttle. Once onboard and the engines are prepped, Cal boards the shuttle.



Let them RP with Cal. He has been trying to find other surviving Jedi, and has been reaching out to them with the force, since three force sensitives have been travelling together. He will agree to teach them the ways of the force, and offers to take them to Ilum to build lightsabers.

 End the session at a natural point
