# Session004 Outline - 4/3/2021

### Session Summary

*The players finally arrive near the location the Jedi Holocron indicated on Acherin. Acherin is a highly dense jungle planet, and they can't find a place to set down their ship close to the location. They land as close as they can, and journey to the location. Once their, they find the remains of a Jedi Encampment from the days of the Republic, where they encounter the Grand Inquisitor, and are rescued by Cal Kestus*



### Session Outline

> As you drop out of hyperspace, you have arrived at the planet Acherin, a dense Jungle planet with many rivers and natural features, and not much obvious civilization. You bring the ship toward the location marked on the Holocron, but it is dense jungle, and there is nowhere nearby to set the ship down.

`Players will presumably attempt to find a suitable place to land as close as they can get from the location`

* When they do set the ship down, regardless how, they are **~50 miles (a two-day walk)** from the Holocrons location
* If the players decide too, they may be permitted to record a local map onto a datapad to help navigate the jungle

> As you begin to journey through the jungle, you find that much of the convenient path is obstructed by thick vines
* A Strength check of DC12 is required to cut through the vines, or a more creative solution may be presented
  * For every failed check, the PC lose a half-hour of travel time
