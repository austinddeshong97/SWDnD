### Session Overview

*The players finally arrive near the location the Jedi Holocron indicated on Acherin. Acherin is a highly dense jungle planet, and they can't find a place to set down their ship close to the location. They land as close as they can, and journey to the location, fighting some Kowakian Monkey-Lizard Swarms on the way. Once there, they find the remains of a Jedi Encampment from the days of the Republic, and a Juvenile Rancor inside a tower. Upon attempting to leave, they encounter the Grand Inquisitor, and are rescued by Cal Kestis*
