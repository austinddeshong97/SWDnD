# Campaign 01 - Session 001 - MM/DD/2021

## Before First Session

`Each player will receive the following overview for the immediate context and circumstances surrounding their character`



#### Kyrie Alatya

> Kyrie crash-landed on Nanth'ri after the Repulsor-lifts failed on his ship. He walked about 15mi to the nearest settlement, which, lucky for him, was a spaceport. He found an Ithorian ship master willing to help him repair his ship. He payed the Ithorian 1,500cr to retrieve his ship from the surrounding forest where he crashed, and repair it.
>
> A few days later, he returned to check on his ship, only to be told by the Ithorian that it was beyond repair and all that he was able to salvage was the Sublight drive engines, and refuses to give Kyrie back his deposit, as the Ithorian's crew still labored in trying to repair the ship.
>
> Enraged, and all but out of credits, Kyrie journeys to the cantina adjacent to the main landing bays in an attempt to find a way off this planet and on to his next job...

* Kyrie starts this adventure with 200cr, a set of Sublight Drive Engines, and whatever gear he normally carries



#### OshKosh B'Gosh

> OshKosh has been roaming the galaxy in search of answers, and seeks knowledge of the greater world. The Sublight Drives on his ship, a BT-7 Thunderclap known as *The Sentinel's Stand*, are shot. Looking for a place to find repairs, he felt a strange draw to the planet Nanth'ri. He sets the *Sentinel's Stand* down in Docking Bay 3 at the Totora spaceport.
>
> Perhaps he can get some information on where to find decent drive parts in the local cantina, and maybe find out something interesting about this part of the galaxy along the way...

* OshKosh starts this adventure with 1000cr and whatever gear he normally carries



#### Zevaa Cir'du

> Zevaa just completed a job for a local Rebel cell on Nanth'ri. She eliminated key Imperial officers at the city of Ba'lorka and allowed the Rebels to steal a shuttle with Imperial data on board. She is currently lying low in Totora, but wants to get off world sooner rather than later in case things get sticky. Maybe she can find a ship off world in the cantina...

* Zevaa starts this adventure with 5000cr and whatever gear she normally carries



## Pre-Session Debrief

### Overview of Spacecraft Interaction and Mechanics

#### Nomenclature

* Navicomputer: Contains a map of the galaxy, can calculate lightspeed jumps, and can find hyperspace lanes
* Helm: Main controls for piloting a ship. 
* Weapons: Some ships have weapon controls at the helm, some have a separate weapon terminal, some have independent turrets that can be manned.
* Sublight Drive: Engines that let the ship maneuver through real-space
* Repulsor-lifts: Engines that keep a ship in the sky when within a planets atmosphere or gravitational pull.
* Hyperdrive: Engine that allows the ship to leave real-space and move through hyperspace at lightspeed. There are different classes of hyperdrives that can either shorten or lengthen the duration of lightspeed journeys.



#### Mechanics

* Whenever a jump to lightspeed is to occur, the hyperdrive must be primed, and the journey must be programmed into the ships navigation
* In order to prime the Hyperdrive, you must be out of a planets orbit, and it take 1 minute to power up.
* The jump to lightspeed can be calculated by a character at the Navicomputer, or by a droid with the necessary capabilities.
* To avoid being detected by enemy scanners, all systems on a ship must be powered off, even droids.
* If you are super vague when describing an action, I may not tell you to be more specific, I may just give you a harder DC, and vice-versa. More RP, lower DC.



#### Notes



### Opportunity to Modify Character Sheets



### Ground Rules

* The only information readily available to you as a player is whatever you can find in the Player's Handbook. Anything beyond that must be cleared by the GM on a case-by-case basis.
* This includes the Galaxy Map. If your character wants to query the map, find a terminal, or use the ships Navicomputer.
* Information about NPCs, ships, enemies, objects, cities, etc, must be learned (within reason). Your characters is not omniscient, so if you don't know something, find a way to find it out. Maybe there's a reason you don't know that thing
  * Species images and general info is okay, and I'll try to have those ready if needed.
* You all will be responsible for your own character sheets, so I may be poking you all for info now and then



#### Notes



## Contextual Debrief

> Nanth'ri is primarily a foresty planet, but also has some grassland regions. It is a mid-rim world under partial Imperial control. The small city of Totora is a spaceport and marketplace, and is frequented by traders and travelers, since Nanth'ri is on a converging hyperspace route.

> You are all sitting at the bar in the *Yub Grub Cantina* adjacent to the docking bays of the spaceport.



## Gameplay

`Let the players explore and interact with each other or NPCs in the cantina, as they desire`



`They will assumedly find someone to repair Kyrie's ship, and may explore the market and shops while that is underway`



`Once they decide to return to the *Stand* and take off, they may get a tour from OshKosh. When they go to embark, the following occurs:`



> As you are about to lift off and set out, the hangar bay doors above you begin to close, and the bay lights illuminate to compensate for the loss of sunlight. Out of the cockpit windows, three squads of Imperial stormtroopers enter the Docking Bay and start to encircle your ship, followed by a figure in a gray armored uniform that stands out from the rest. A steady beeping and accompanying light emits from the comms panel, you are being hailed.



<mark>If they decide to ignore the hail:</mark>

> The stormtoopers board the *Sentinel's Stand*, followed by the officer.

`Continue with the officers remarks bellow`



<mark>If they answer the hail:</mark>

> You open the hailing channel and hear the following:
>
> "This is Agent Barda of the Imperial Security Bureau. We have your ship surrounded. Disembark immediately with your hands on your heads, and leave your weapons behind. Failure to comply, and I shall have my troopers fire on sight."



<mark>If they inquire as to the meaning behind the raid:</mark>

`This may happen before or after they disembark`

`Alter tense to apply to whomever asks`

`As soon as they exit the ship, they will be bound by the troopers`

> "You are suspected to be rebel sympathizers, if not rebel conspirators. You will be brought back to a local base for questioning."



> The Imperials take you two hangars over, where an Imperial Shuttle resides. You board the shuttle with one of the three squads and Agent Barda, and are strapped into seats.



> About ten minutes into the journey, you overhear two of the stormtroopers.
>
> "Did you hear about the upcoming inspection?"
>
> "An inspection? On Nanth'ri? You better check your information trooper. Command doesn't care about us all the way out here."
>
> "TK-384 was on duty when the Captain was notified. Something about an inquisition or something."
>
> "Inquisition? Doesn't make any sense to me."
>
> "I don't understand it either. Maybe it has to do with those artifacts Scout team Delta brought in."
>
> *pilot*: "TK-629, TK-938, cut the chatter. We're making our approach."



> You feel the shuttle come to a rest, and the stormtroopers unlock the seat harnesses and escort you off the craft. As you descend the ramp, you see you are on the rooftop landing platform of a small base in the middle of a forest somewhere on the planet.
>
> The troopers escort you inside, down a hall, downstairs, and into a detention cell.

`Allow players to read the signs on the walls as they pass by if possible`

> They remove your binders and lock the cell ray shields.



<mark>If the players figure out a way to open the ray shields:</mark>

```
Hidden in one of the beds is a power cell they can use to overload the shield controls. Use the following benchmark to determine Technology DC based on how verbose they decide to be

DC5 Extra-verbose on how power cell will be used
DC10 Not super detailed but they have the idea
DC15 Fairly vague, but some effort was put forward
DC20 "I use the power cell to open the shield"
```



<mark>If the players wait it out, Agent Barda returns to interrogate them:</mark>

`This can be fairly free-form. Barda is convinced that he captured the right people, but if the players make a strong enough argument, he doesn't have much hard evidence.`



<mark>If the players talk their way into a release:</mark>

Requires decent reason and a **Persuasion (DC15)**

> "As much as I would have liked to have three rebels out of circulation, I'm afraid today is not that day."
>
> "My troops and I have a more sweeps to make, so getting back is going to be your problem. Totora is 20 miles east of here, and you are more than welcome to make the journey on foot."



However the players get out of the cell, at this point they may explore the base.



<mark>If they escaped the cell before talking to Barda</mark>: The stormtroopers and officers will try and capture them on sight.

<mark>If they convinced Barda to release them</mark>: Imperials won't interfere with them unless they loiter, act suspicious, or go where they don't belong.



**Generic Checks while exploring**

Persuade a trooper or officer **Persuasion or Deception (DC10)**

Access a terminal without any other tools **Technology (DC10)**



`The players will hopefully find the holo message from the Grand Inquisitor regarding the holocrons and Cal Kestus before leaving. If not, have them hear a call when passing by the storage room.`

`They will also hopefully steal three of the speeders to get back to Totora, where they will open the bay doors, board their ship and depart`

`If more time is needed, have them be pursued by 3 TIE Fighters`

`Have the players decide where to go next and end session`



<mark>If the players want to open each holicron before deciding where to go</mark>:

Roll a **(DC10)** to open a Hol0cron

On opening of Jedi Holocron:

> The Holocron begins to float in the air and glow as the corners rotate synchronously. Two different glowing images appear as the holocron projects them above itself; The first, a section of galaxy map, the second, what appears to be a map of a large section of a planets surface. Both images have what seems to be clear directions to specific locations on each.
>
> When cross-referenced with the Navicomputer, the planet indicated on the map is Acherin

On opening of Sith Holocron:

> This holocron emits a spine-tingling scream as it opens. Galactic coordinates in a scrawled script are projected above it.
>
> When punched in to the Navicomputer, it pulls up the planet Batuu
